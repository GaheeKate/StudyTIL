# Laravel :: Lifecycle

### The lifecycle refers to the sequence of events that occur during the processing of a request. Here is an explanation of the Laravel lifecycle:

The starting point of every request in Laravel is from the `public/index.php` file.
Depending on your web server configuration (Apache, Nginx), all requests are directed to the `public/index.php` file.

The first step in the Laravel lifecycle is to create an instance of the service container.
The service container is responsible for managing and resolving dependencies within the application.

Next, the request is sent to either the HTTP kernel or the console kernel.
The HTTP kernel handles requests coming from the web, while the console kernel handles commands executed through the command line.

In the HTTP kernel, the request is received and a response is returned.
The HTTP kernel handles various tasks such as routing, middleware execution, and controller dispatching.

One of the crucial steps in the kernel bootstrap process is loading the service providers.
All service providers for the application are managed in the `config/app.php` configuration file.

Laravel instantiates each service provider from the provider list.
Once instantiated, the `register` method is called on each provider.

After the providers are registered, the `boot` method is called on each provider.
This is where providers can perform additional setup and bootstrapping tasks.

Finally, as the response flows back through the middleware, the `handle` method of the HTTP kernel returns the response object.
The `index.php` file then calls the `send` method on the response, which sends the response content back to the user's web browser.
