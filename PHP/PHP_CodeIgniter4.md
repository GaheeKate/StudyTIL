- Routing: is for a specific method of a controller.
- offers a page or a method based on the url from a client
- the routes uses placeholder, regex and HTTP method
- Group(): groups the routes, make the first segment prefix, reduces the typing. 
- uses prefix to process the controller in namepace
- if method is not provided. it uses index method
- match(): can provide multiple HTTP methods
- The match() method allows for the provision of multiple HTTP methods as an array, and when a request is made for a route that is in the second segment, it processes the function in the third segment of the route.
- add() can be used for all HTTP methods.
