### spin lock and window violation
- spin lock refers to a locking mechanism implemented by repeatedly trying to enter a critical section until entry is possible. Busy waiting occurs as the thread continuously loops until it can enter the critical section.

- Because spin locks do not rely on the operating system's scheduling support, there is no context switch for the thread holding the lock. If the critical section can be entered quickly, this avoids the overhead of context switches and can be more efficient. However, in cases where entering the critical section takes a significant amount of time, it might lead to reduced CPU efficiency, as the thread does not yield the CPU to other threads.

- Spin locks are most effective in multiprocessor systems, where multiple processors or cores can execute concurrently.

- In summary, spin locks can enhance performance in certain situations, but their effectiveness depends on the expected duration of entering the critical section and the characteristics of the system. They are particularly well-suited for multiprocessor environments.

- A window violation occurs when a thread, while holding a spin lock, enters a region of code where it could block. This is problematic because if another thread attempts to acquire the same spin lock while the first thread is blocking, it may result in a deadlock situation. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a lock.

- To avoid window violations, it's generally recommended to keep the critical sections protected by spin locks short and avoid any operations that might lead to blocking (e.g., acquiring another lock, waiting on I/O, etc.) while holding a spin lock.
