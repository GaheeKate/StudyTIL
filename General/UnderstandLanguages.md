# Understand languages 

Today I studied languages
- Understand languages
- do not use libraries and frameworks without knowing that what kind of problems
they are trying to solve.
- libraries and frameworks developed to manage DOM, minimize state change management, and help developers focus more on function development and user interface.
- understand why they are there, and how to use them effectively.
- The DOM (Document Object Model) represents the web page as a tree structure

#### Frontend
- HTML
- CSS

- NoSQL
  - how do they scale
  - sharding
