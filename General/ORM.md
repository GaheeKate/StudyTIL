# ORM

ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It is a technique used to automatically map (connect) objects, which are concepts implemented in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), to the data stored in Relational Databases (RDB). In other words, ORM bridges the gap between the object-oriented world and the relational database world by automatically generating SQL statements based on object relationships.

ORM helps resolve the mismatch between objects and tables since they are not inherently compatible. By using ORM, you can work with objects and their relationships, and the ORM framework takes care of generating the appropriate SQL statements. This allows developers to interact with the database indirectly through objects, eliminating the need to write SQL statements manually.

ORM simplifies database operations by providing an object-oriented approach and reducing the need for manual SQL queries, ultimately increasing productivity and code quality.

Advantages of ORM include:

1. Object-oriented code: ORM enables developers to focus on programming using object models rather than writing SQL statements directly. It eliminates the need for boilerplate code associated with SQL, such as declaration, assignment, and termination. By using ORM, you can improve code readability and maintainability, as object-oriented code is more expressive and easier to understand than raw SQL.
2. Reusability, maintainability, and refactoring: ORM allows for writing independent and reusable code. Since the mapping information is explicit, it reduces dependencies on the database schema, making it easier to reuse and maintain code. Additionally, refactoring code becomes easier as ORM provides a layer of abstraction between the application and the database, allowing changes to the underlying database schema without affecting the codebase.
